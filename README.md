# Hiretrace AI

Hiretrace AI is an advanced artificial intelligence system that combines the power of ChatGPT, Twitter sentiment analysis, and applicant fit prediction to assist recruiters and hiring managers in evaluating job applicants. This application analyzes an applicant's Twitter activity, performs sentiment analysis on their tweets, and predicts their suitability for a specific company based on their expressed sentiments.

## Features

- **ChatGPT Integration**: Hiretrace AI utilizes ChatGPT, a sophisticated language model, to understand and process the textual data from Twitter.
- **Twitter Sentiment Analysis**: The application analyzes an applicant's Twitter posts to determine the sentiment expressed in their tweets (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Applicant Fit Prediction**: Based on the sentiment analysis, Hiretrace AI predicts the potential fit of an applicant with a specific company by assessing the alignment between the applicant's expressed sentiments on Twitter and the desired attributes of the company.
- **User Interaction**: Hiretrace AI provides a user-friendly interface where recruiters and hiring managers can input an applicant's Twitter handle or Twitter data and retrieve the sentiment analysis results and fit prediction score.
- **Data Privacy and Ethics**: Hiretrace AI ensures data privacy by securely processing applicant data and adhering to strict privacy guidelines. It avoids biases by focusing solely on public tweets and excluding personal information.
